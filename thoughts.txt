Every card played is played onto the stack
The previous card on top of the stack determines how the newly added card resolves according to the associated Event
Whether or not the Event has an appropriate ResultCondition, any played Action Card constitutes an attack on the highest NPC in the stack

An eventtrigger is an object that, given a card, determines whether a particular event will follow the current one

When a card is played on an event, the event first plays the card and deals relevant damage.
It then checks whether any results match the card criteria: e.g. Force 2 would mean that the result matches if the card played was Force and the NPC has no more than 2 life remaining (if there's no NPC, then it checks that the card strength is greater than or equal to 2)
It only uses the strongest matching result for the strongest component of the attack
If any of the matching results resolve the event, the event and played card resolve instantly
If the event is still in play, it then checks for matching eventtriggers in much the same way
If there is a match, the new event is added to the stack
If there is no matching eventtrigger, the played card resolves, and the default result activates

	
Example EventStacks:
	Location >> (Card, Scenario) >> (Card, Scenario) ... >> Card
	
	Bar >> (Bartender, Bartender_Discuss) >> (Key, Bartender_Key_Discuss) >> Charm 7
	Bartender has 2 Charm Resist and 5 action cards, his top action card is Force 1, so he has no defense to Charm, and his top 7 - 2 cards are aligned to you, which is all of them
	He needs at least 2 cards in his action deck aligned to him to hold onto the key, so Charm 7 results in success, resolving both it and the Key Discussion card
	The final stack is
	Bar >> (Bartender, Bartender_Discuss)
	The player can play Leave
	Bar >> (Bartender, Bartender_Discuss) >> Leave
	Leave resolves itself and Bartender
	
	Docks
	The player plays Thug 5
	Docks >> Thug 5
	This summons a Level 5 Thug and starts a discussion with him. Thug 5 remains in play. The player plays Force 3
	Docks >> (Thug 5, Thug_5_Discussion) >> Force 3
	This resolves as an attack, so
	Docks >> (Thug 5, Thug_5_Discussion) >> (Force 3, Attack (Thug_5))
	Thug 5 has 3 Resist and his top card is Resist 3, which gets a bonus of +1 for being used against Force, so the player fails and takes 1 damage
	Docks >> (Thug 5, Thug_5_Discussion) >> (Force 3, Attack (Thug_5)) >> Resist 3
	Docks >> (Thug 5, Thug_5_Discussion)
